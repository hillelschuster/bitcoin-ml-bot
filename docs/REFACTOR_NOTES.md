# Refactor Notes

## Structural Cleanup (2023-04-15)

### Removed Wrapper Files

The following wrapper files were removed as part of a structural cleanup to eliminate redundancy and improve maintainability:

- `src/exchange.py` - Wrapper around `src/core/exchange.py`
- `src/risk_manager.py` - Wrapper around `src/core/risk_manager.py`
- `src/logger.py` - Wrapper around `src/utils/logger.py`
- `src/notifier.py` - Wrapper around `src/utils/notifier.py`
- `src/reporter.py` - Wrapper around `src/monitoring/reporter.py`

### Modularized Trading Bot

The monolithic `src/core/bot.py` was refactored into a modular structure:

- `src/core/bot/orchestrator.py` - Main orchestrator that initializes and coordinates all components
- `src/core/bot/state_manager.py` - Manages position state and circuit breaker state
- `src/core/bot/safety_monitor.py` - Monitors drawdown and manages circuit breaker logic
- `src/core/bot/exit_handler.py` - Handles position exit logic with retry mechanisms
- `src/core/bot/position_manager.py` - Manages position entry logic and stop-loss placement
- `src/core/bot/strategy.py` - Trading strategy logic and signal generation
- `src/core/bot/risk_manager.py` - Advanced risk management and position sizing
- `src/core/bot/regime_filter.py` - Market regime detection (trending/choppy)
- `src/core/utils/` - Utility functions for sentiment analysis, retry logic, strategy execution, and trade reasoning

### Import Path Updates

All import statements that referenced these wrapper files were updated to import directly from the source modules:

- Updated `run.py` to import from `src/core/bot/orchestrator.py` instead of `src/core/bot.py`
- Updated `scripts/update_price_feed.py` to import from `src/core/exchange.py` and `src/utils/config.py`
- Updated `src/utils/backtest.py` to import from core modules directly
- Updated test files to use the new modular structure

### File Organization

The codebase now follows a cleaner structure with:

- Core trading logic in `src/core/`
  - Modular bot components in `src/core/bot/`
  - Bot utilities in `src/core/bot/utils/`
- Utility functions in `src/utils/`
- Model components in `src/models/`
- Monitoring tools in `src/monitoring/`
- Tests organized in `tests/`, with:
  - `tests/diagnostics/` for integration and circuit tests
  - `tests/core_utils/` for logic-layer unit tests
  - Functional module tests directly in `tests/` (e.g. price, logger, state)

### Benefits

- Reduced redundancy and duplication
- Clearer import paths
- Improved maintainability
- Better organization for future extensions
- Modular components with single responsibilities
- Easier testing of individual components
- Better separation of concerns
- Simplified debugging and troubleshooting

### Note

This refactor was purely structural and did not change any functionality. All logic remains intact, but is now organized in a more maintainable way.
